# CPP-Tutorial
Just a tutorial project to help learn git, github, C++ and SDL

The scope of this project will change as I discover and solve new problems, but the general focus is on coding for game development. I will be exploring patterns, algorithms and data structures and any other concepts that crop up. This will also help me get used to working in git!
